This Repo is all about the important concepts of Javascript .
i have started from Promise ,the most important and most asked in the interview .

 A promise is a special Js Objects that also  are considered as a
 readibility enhancer .They get immediately returned from a function 
 setup to return a promise WE can also add a functionality we want to add
 until the future task is done .A promise is in one of these states 
  . pending : initial state ,neither fulfilled nor rejected .
  . fulfilled : meaning that the operation was completed successfully .
  .rejected : meaning that operation failed .

  what's the main reason of using promise  ? 
   .The first reason is prevention of callback hell but for that only 
    promise is not used bcoz if we will us promise then there is also a chance of promise hell .
   . the most valid reason  is inversion of control withthe use of this problem is 
   eliminated .
